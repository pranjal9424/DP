Can we reverse a linked list in less than O(n)?

Ans:- It doesn’t look possible to reverse a simple singly linked list in less than O(n). A simple singly linked list can only be reversed in O(n) time using recursive and iterative methods. 

A memory-efficient doubly linked list with head and tail pointers can also be reversed in O(1) time by swapping head and tail pointers.
